# Compendium-to-Card
Converting DnDAppFiles (XML) Compendiums to RPG Card (json)

This project was made for convert [DnD 5 Ed. Not official Compendium] (https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles) to [Crobi's RPG Cards generator] (https://github.com/crobi/rpg-cards).

Using: `python3 ./compendium_to_card.py ../DnDAppFiles/Items/Magic\ Items.xml rpg_cards.json` 
Yes, It's required python3 because python2 provides some problems with unicode symbols :)
